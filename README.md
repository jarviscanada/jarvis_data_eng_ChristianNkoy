# Christian Nkoy . Jarvis Consulting

Hi, my name is Christian, and I studied computer science and mathematics at university. I work at Jarvis as a software developer. At Jarvis, I have the opportunity to learn and utilize relevant technologies and skills in software development. I love applying logical and abstract thinking to solve complex problems. Being a software developer is exciting because it allows me to solve real-life problems and impact how people use technology. I enjoy working in a collaborative environment and am just as comfortable working independently. My strengths include a solid mathematical background, the ability to communicate effectively in multiple languages, and an insatiable desire to learn and continually improve. You can catch me on a soccer field or playing a strategy game when I am not writing code.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ChristianNkoy](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ChristianNkoy)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ChristianNkoy/tree/master/linux_sql)]: I designed a monitoring agent for a Linux cluster. I provisioned a PostgreSQL instance for data persistence using Docker. Next, I wrote Bash scripts to collect hardware specifications and resource usage data for each host in the cluster. Then, I leveraged CentOS’s crontab to automate the collection of resource usage data. Finally, I tested the MVP using multiple queries on a single machine and deployed it using Git and Docker.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ChristianNkoy/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: In progress.
  - JDBC App: I implemented an application that performed CRUD operations against a database. I utilized Docker to instantiate a PostgreSQL database. Then, I connected to and modified the database using Java’s JDBC API and DAO. Next, I tested the application manually with multiple SQL queries. Finally, I deployed the app using Docker.
  - Grep App: I architectured an application that mimics Linux’s grep command. I took advantage of Java’s tools and features, such as Interface, Stream API, and Lambda expressions, as well as IntelliJ, to implement the app. In addition, I used Maven for package management and tested the application with multiple text files and string inputs. I also used Docker for deployment.


## Highlighted Projects
**Nim-move** [[GitHub](https://github.com/chrisnkoy/nim-move)]: I worked with a team on designing an algorithm that used a min-max tree to determine the best move in the game of Nim, given a game state. Leveraged Python to implement the algorithm. I tested the application manually by playing multiple games and keeping track of winning/losing records. The program won first place in a competition.

**VM** [[GitHub](https://github.com/chrisnkoy/vm)]: I implemented a virtual machine using Java and multi-threaded programming features such as Runnable, Thread, Lock, and BufferedReader. I used manual testing to ensure that the functionalities of the VM worked correctly. Finally, I used Git to deploy the app.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (November 2022 - present)**: I work on various projects using relevant technologies such as Linux/Bash, Java, PostgreSQL, Git, and Docker. I collaborate with a team by leveraging the Agile methodology for software development to achieve project goals. As a team lead, I organized daily scrums and communicated with the team about sprint goals, progress, and impediments. I also generated a daily summary of scrum meetings and made it available to the scrum master and product owner.

**Technical Services Specialist - Seasonal, Sterling Operations (May 2018 - October 2021)**: I employed innovative and eﬀicient measures to treat 750+ sites for vegetation and erosion control every season with a 95+% success rate. I trained and mentored new employees and helped them achieve competency in their roles in minimal time. In addition, I communicated regularly with stakeholders to plan and coordinate the implementation of control measures.
