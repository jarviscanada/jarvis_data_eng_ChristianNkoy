summary: "Hi, my name is Christian, and I studied computer science and mathematics at university. I work at Jarvis as a software developer. I love applying logical and abstract thinking to solve complex problems. I aspire to become a full-stack software developer. I am excited at the idea of building applications that solve real-life problems and impact how people use technology. My strengths include a solid mathematical background, the ability to communicate effectively in multiple languages, and an insatiable desire to learn and continually improve. You can catch me on a soccer field or playing a strategy game when I am not writing code."

    description: "I developed a monitoring agent for a Linux cluster. The monitoring agent collected hardware specifications and resource usage data for each host in the cluster.  I collected data using Bash scripts. I leveraged PostgreSQL for data persistence and used CentOS’s crontab to automate the collection of resource usage data. I tested the MVP using multiple queries on a single machine and deployed it using Git and Docker."
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "JDBC App: I implemented an application that performed CRUD operations against an RDBMS database. The application connected to a PostgreSQL database and executed SQL statements on it. I used Java's JDBC API and the DAO pattern to achieve this. I tested the application manually with multiple SQL queries. I used Docker for deployment."
      - "Grep App: I developed an application that mimics Linux’s grep command. The app scanned an input file for matching strings and wrote each line where a match occurred onto an output file. I took advantage of Java’s tools and features, such as Stream API, and Lambda expressions, as well as IntelliJ, to implement the app. I used Maven for package management and tested the application with multiple text files and string inputs. I also used Docker for deployment."

    description: "I worked with a team on designing an algorithm that used a min-max tree to determine the best move in the game of Nim, given a game state. I used Python to implement the algorithm. I tested the application manually by playing multiple games and keeping track of winning/losing records. The program won first place in a competition."  
  - name: "VM"
    git_url: "https://github.com/chrisnkoy/vm"
    description: "I implemented a virtual machine using Java and multi-threaded programming features such as Runnable, Thread, Lock, and BufferedReader. I used manual testing to ensure that the functionalities of the VM worked correctly. I deployed the app using GitHub."
