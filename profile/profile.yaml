summary: "Hi, my name is Christian, and I studied computer science and mathematics at university. I work at Jarvis as a software developer. At Jarvis, I have the opportunity to learn and utilize relevant technologies and skills in software development. I love applying logical and abstract thinking to solve complex problems. Being a software developer is exciting because it allows me to solve real-life problems and impact how people use technology. I enjoy working in a collaborative environment and am just as comfortable working independently. My strengths include a solid mathematical background, the ability to communicate effectively in multiple languages, and an insatiable desire to learn and continually improve. You can catch me on a soccer field or playing a strategy game when I am not writing code."

    description: "I designed a monitoring agent for a Linux cluster. I provisioned a PostgreSQL instance for
data persistence using Docker. Next, I wrote Bash scripts to collect hardware specifications and resource usage data for each host in the cluster. Then, I leveraged CentOS’s crontab to automate the collection of resource usage data. Finally, I tested the MVP using multiple queries on a single machine and deployed it using Git and Docker."
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter App: In progress."
      - "JDBC App: I implemented an application that performed CRUD operations against a database. I utilized Docker to instantiate a PostgreSQL database. Then, I connected to and modified the database using Java’s JDBC API and DAO. Next, I tested the application manually with multiple SQL queries. Finally, I deployed the app using Docker."
      - "Grep App: I architectured an application that mimics Linux’s grep command. I took advantage of Java’s tools and features, such as Interface, Stream API, and Lambda expressions, as well as IntelliJ, to implement the app. In addition, I used Maven for package management and tested the application with multiple text files and string inputs. I also used Docker for deployment."

    description: "I worked with a team on designing an algorithm that used a min-max tree to determine the best move in the game of Nim, given a game state. Leveraged Python to implement the algorithm. I tested the application manually by playing multiple games and keeping track of winning/losing records. The program won first place in a competition."  
  - name: "VM"
    git_url: "https://github.com/chrisnkoy/vm"
    description: "I implemented a virtual machine using Java and multi-threaded programming features such as Runnable, Thread, Lock, and BufferedReader. I used manual testing to ensure that the functionalities of the VM worked correctly. Finally, I used Git to deploy the app."
