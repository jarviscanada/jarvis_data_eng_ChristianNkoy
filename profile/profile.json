I collaborated with a team on designing an algorithm that utilized a min-max tree to determine the optimal move in the game of Nim for a given game state. I implemented the algorithm using Python. I tested the application by playing multiple games and keeping track of the winning/losing record. The program was successful, winning first place in a competition.",

The monitoring agent collects hardware specifications for each host once, then automatically gathers their resource usage data every minute. I used Bash scripts for the collection of data. I leveraged CentOS's crontab to automate the resource usage data collection process. The data is persisted in a PostgreSQL database.
